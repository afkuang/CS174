#### What was implemented?

	(1) Get a simple WebGL element (canvas) to display without error.
	(2) Implement the various shader codes needed to get primitives onto the screen as illustrated in the lecture and in Chapter 2 of the text.
	(3) Implement the Sierpinski Gasket algorithm from Chapter 2 of the text and display it on the canvas. Use the coordinates (-0.5, -0.5), (0.5, -0.5) and (0.0, 0.5) as the initial seed points of the algorithm.
	(4) Implement the assignment in a clean and understandable manner. You can use whatever coding style you prefer but your code must be readily understandable for grading (e.g. comments).
